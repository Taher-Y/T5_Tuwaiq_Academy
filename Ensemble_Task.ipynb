You will be working with a dataset of traffic jams.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","The dataset that will be used in this task is `Traffic_Jam.csv`\n","\n","## Instructions\n","- Follow the steps outlined below.\n","- Write your code in the empty code cells.\n","- Comment on your code to explain your reasoning.\n","\n","## Dataset Overview\n","This dataset contains traffic data including various counts of vehicle types across different times and days. Below are samples of these columns:\n","\n","* `Time`: The timestamp of the traffic count (in intervals).\n","* `Date`: The day of the month the data was recorded.\n","* `Day of the Week`: The day of the week for the recorded data.\n","* `CarCount`: The number of cars counted during the time interval.\n","* `BikeCount`: The number of bikes counted during the time interval.\n","* `BusCount`: The number of buses counted during the time interval.\n","* `TruckCount`: The number of trucks counted during the time interval.\n","* `Total`: Total vehicles counted during the time interval.\n","* `Traffic Situation`: Qualitative assessment of the traffic (e.g., normal, congested).\n","\n","## Goal\n","The primary goal of this exam is to develop a predictive model capable of determining the `Traffic Situation` based on your choice of features provided in the dataset. Students are expected to apply ensemble methods to build and evaluate their models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0243f5f9","metadata":{"id":"0243f5f9"},"source":["# Import
