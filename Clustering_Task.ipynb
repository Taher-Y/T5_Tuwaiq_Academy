    "# Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Exam\n",
    "Welcome to the weekly project on clustering and dimensionality reduction. You will be working with a dataset of traffic accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset that will be used in this task is `Traffic_Accidents.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- Follow the steps outlined below.\n",
    "- Write your code in the empty code cells.\n",
    "- Comment on your code to explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset contains information about traffic accidents, including location, weather conditions, road conditions, and more. Below are sample of these columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Location_Easting_OSGR`: Easting coordinate of the accident location.\n",
    "* `Location_Northing_OSGR`: Northing coordinate of the accident location.\n",
    "* `Longitude`: Longitude of the accident site.\n",
    "* `Latitude`: Latitude of the accident site.\n",
    "* `Police_Force`: Identifier for the police force involved.\n",
    "* `Accident_Severity`: Severity of the accident.\n",
    "* `Number_of_Vehicles`: Number of vehicles involved in the accident.\n",
    "* `Number_of_Casualties`: Number of casualties in the accident.\n",
    "* `Date`: Date of the accident.\n",
    "* `Day_of_Week`: Day of the week when the accident occurred.\n",
    "* `Speed_limit`: Speed limit in the area where the accident occurred.\n",
    "* `Weather_Conditions`: Weather conditions at the time of the accident.\n",
    "* `Road_Surface_Conditions`: Condition of the road surface during the accident.\n",
    "* `Urban_or_Rural_Area`: Whether the accident occurred in an urban or rural area.\n",
    "* `Year`: Year when the accident was recorded.\n",
    "* Additional attributes related to road type, pedestrian crossing, light conditions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The primary goal is to analyze the accidents based on their geographical location.\n"
