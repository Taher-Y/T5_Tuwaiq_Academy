        "3. **Training Process**: Discuss why you chose your batch size, number of epochs, and optimizer. How did these choices affect the training process? Did you experiment with different values, and what were the outcomes?\n",
        "4. **Loss Function and Metrics**: Why did you choose the specific loss function and evaluation metrics? How do they align with the objective of the task (e.g., regression vs classification)?\n",
        "5. **Regularization Techniques**: If you used regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay, explain why you implemented them and how they influenced the model's performance.\n",
        "6. **Model Evaluation**: Justify your approach to evaluating the model. Why did you choose the specific performance metrics, and how do they reflect the model's success in solving the task?\n",
        "7. **Model Tuning (If Done)**: Describe any tuning you performed (e.g., hyperparameter tuning) and why you felt it was necessary. How did these adjustments improve model performance?\n",
        "8. **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Analyze whether the model encountered any overfitting or underfitting during training. What strategies could you implement to mitigate these issues?"
